# Login flask app

This is a standard flask application that offers a login and sign up service. It has a database with migrations.

The idea of this project is to create a simple login service that can be scalated and used for more complex applications.

## Use

To run it just use `python app.py` and the web will be displayed in the local host port 8000. There you can create any user and login with it.
